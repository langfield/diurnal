Let's talk about screens. When the user gets a notification, it contains the
following data:
- Title
- Weight
- Minutes
- Start time

Then, they click the notification, and they're brought to the app. Our first
priority is collecting measurements. So they're brought to a screen that
prompts them with several buttons to select what they did during the last
session. We also want to be able to measure when a task is completed early, or
when other things were done in a block that were unplanned. So there should
eventually be functionality for typing in how long the task took, and adding
additional completed tasks. Maybe there are a couple tap-to-select options for
likely completion times (assuming the completion time is less than the time
allocated for the block).

But right now, we only want the minimal feature set necessary. We want a
program similar to the Erlang ticket system.

So we'll have a screen that prompts you with the data given above in the
notification, but this time for the previous task, and asks if you completed
that block, yes or no. So just a blank screen with the data and two buttons,
yes/no. Very simple. Maybe the time left as well.

Here's a visual:


Brush.+Floss.+Tongue.+Mouthwash.          21:35 -> 23:15 UTC+0
0/100min 3N

                  pass            fail


                         00:35



At any point, when the user opens the app, they'll be presented with this
screen. If they have already completed the block that's currently due, they'll
see the prompt for the next block.

Won't fix
=========
- No screen that shows the whole day, or other blocks besides the current
  prompt.
- No timer until start of next block for when you've completed something early.
- No editing.
- No recording how long a block actually took (yet).
- Timer doesn't turn different colors when time is low.
- All text is the same size.
- No padding between rows.
